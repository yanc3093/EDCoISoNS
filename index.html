                    About this project
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was my Final Year Project (FYP). It was a group work completed in October 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different from the ordinary school assignments, this project was supervised by a lecturer from the School of 
                    Information Technology at Monash University Malaysia, who acted as the project client or customer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of this project was to design and create a system that classifies the images based on the 
                    depicted events into 2 broad categories: social and non-social. Examples of social events are graduation, 
                    birthday, and wedding. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the client's requirement, the system should comprise 3 key deliverables:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An image database with at least 3000 images in each of the 2 categories
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An event driven image classifier (backend)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A graphical user interface (frontend)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The product acceptance criterion was that the event driven image classifier must achieve a prediction accuracy
                    of at least 0.75 or 75%.

                    Project outcomes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was executed in 4 major phases, which followed the waterfall project management methodology:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Requirements phase, during which we collected and documented the client's requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        System design phase, during which we carried out research on the project related topics and derived a 
                        feasible solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implementation phase, during which we implemented the solution according to the planned schedule.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verification phase, during which we checked whether our product meets the client's requirement and 
                        acceptance criterion stipulated at the beginning.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Particularly, the implementation phase comprised 3 subphases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Construct an image database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build an event driven image classifier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a graphical user interface.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To construct an <b>image database</b>, my teammates and I tried to look for a suitable one on the internet. 
                    Eventually, we selectively combined the images from the following 4 datasets:

                <p>
                    As for the <b>event driven image classifier</b>, it is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that classifies the 
                    images using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature, which represents the shapes of the objects 
                    within an image. In this part, I was responsible for writing the code to train and test the model. Below is a 
                    snippet of my codework, which was written using the Python programming language.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/1.png" alt="Codework 1">
                </div>
                <p>
                    According to the model testing results, our event driven image classifier achieves a prediction accuracy of 
                    0.8983 or 89.83%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from that, I was also responsible for writing the code to create a <b>graphical user interface</b>. 
                    Specifically, I used the functions provided by Tkinter, which is a standard GUI library for Python. Below is a 
                    snippet of my codework and a screenshot of the delivered graphical user interface.
